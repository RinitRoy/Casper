  <h1>Casper - The Warrior</h1>
  <img class="hero-img" src="./casper.png" alt="image">

  <p class="para">Casper was born in my street along with 5 other puppies, but sadly, he was a special child. He
    couldn’t
    walk; and he will be crying all day in pain.

    There is a vacant land opposite my house, and he was staying there. The moment I saw him first, I couldn’t control
    my tears; he was in a terrible state. He couldn’t walk, his stomach was bloated, and he was not able to take food.

    I started feeding him milk using a syringe, and after a couple of days I took him to a vet doctor, and after
    checking, he suspected that he might be affected by canine distemper, a deadly virus infection that affects the
    neural system of dogs. I was very sad, but I still wanted to do my best to save him.All these days I am feeding and
    giving him medicine outside my house, as I have already adopted two dogs at this point in time.



    But one night, at 12.30 AM, it was raining heavily, and I woke up and immediately went to the open land to check
    him, and he was fully drenched. If I had not checked him on time, he might have drowned in the water that day. And
    at that time, I decided he couldn’t survive in the streets alone, so I adopted him.

    After several weeks of continuous diet and medication, he started responding well, and thankfully he was not
    affected by canine distemper. He started walking on his own, but his left front leg is not growing as expected; it
    is a birth defect.<br>

    Now after 1.5 years, he is a part of our family. And he is a very sharp, brave, happy dog.



    Things I learned from Casper are to be happy and grateful for what you have in life. Our ability is stronger than
    our disability.</p>
